            <p>Hi, my name is Nemanja Stepanović, and I was born the 10th of January, 1994. I'm from Serbia and I live in the village of Dobrić near Šabac, which is approximately 100 km away from Belgrade, the capital city of Serbia. I have graduated from the Higher Medical and Business-Technological School of Applied Studies in Šabac with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science with a GPA of 8.9/10. The course I took was Information Technology. Since March 2016 I have enthusiastically been studying programming, not only in school, but also via Internet. I think I have tried every possible way of learning, as in, watching many hours of video tutorials, learning through websites like Free Code Camp, Codecademy, Khan Academy, and many others, and also learning through the mobile app SoloLearn. I also finished two courses, eSova (JavaScript) and Clever (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript), coming in at number one in Šabac. The last couple of months I've mostly been reading e-books (I've read seven already). As a result, I now have enough knowledge to make programs in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, C# (inc. LINQ), T-SQL, ASP.NET MVC, etc. I'm currently looking to get a job as a junior programmer using the skills I already possess. I'm a workaholic and I see myself as a future programmer. I love creating stuff with code, it's like having superpowers in real life, and yes, in my younger years I read many comics.</p>
