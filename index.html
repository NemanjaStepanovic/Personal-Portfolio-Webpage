      <p>Hi, my name is Nemanja Stepanović, born January 10 1994. I'm from Serbia and I live in a village of Dobrić near Šabac, approximately 100 km far away from Belgrade, the capital city of Serbia. I have graduated from the High Medical and Business-Technological School of Professional Studies in Šabac with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science with GPA of 8.9/10. The course I took was Information Technology. From March 2016 I have started "aggressively" to learn programming beside school through Internet. I think I have tried every possible way of learning, watched many hours of video tutorials, learning through websites like Free Code Camp, Codecademy, Khan Academy (and many others), learning through mobile app SoloLearn. I also finished two courses eSova (JavaScript; online platform) and Clever (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript; face to face) as a number one attender in my home town Šabac. Last couple of months I mostly read e-books (I read it seven already). So as a result I have knowledge to make programs in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, C# (inc. LINQ), T-SQL, ASP.NET MVC... I currently try to get a job as a junior developer using skills I already know. I'm a workaholic and I see myself in a future as a programmer. I'm loving creating stuff with code, it's like having superpowers in a real, non-fiction world (yes in my younger years I read many comics).</p>
